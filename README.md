# Photogrammetric Computer Vision

This repository contains my exercises and Python implementations for the *Photogrammetric Computer Vision* course in the [Master’s program Geodesy and Geoinformation Science at TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/studying/study-programs/all-programs-offered/study-course/geodesy-and-geoinformation-science-m-sc).

**Supervised by Prof. Olaf Hellwich**, Professor of Computer Vision and Remote Sensing, [Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)](https://www.tu.berlin).

## Structure

Each exercise is stored in its own folder:

- **Exercise 01**: [Homogeneous Coordinates](./ex01_homogeneous_coordinates)
- **Exercise 02**: [Projective Transformation (Homography)](./ex02_projective_transformation_homography)
- **Exercise 03**: [Camera Calibration (DLT)](./ex03_camera_calibration_dlt)
- **Exercise 04**: [Relative Orientation & Fundamental Matrix](./ex04_relative_orientation_fundamental_matrix)
- **Exercise 05**: [Structure from Motion (SfM)](./ex05_structure_from_motion)

## Technologies

* **Python 3**  
  Main programming language used for implementing all photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms.

* **NumPy**  
  Numerical computations, linear algebra operations, and matrix-based formulations.

* **OpenCV**  
  Feature detection, matching, and epipolar geometry computations.

* **Matplotlib**  
  Visualization of intermediate results, projections, and debugging plots.

* **MeshLab**  
  Visualization and inspection of reconstructed 3D point clouds (`.ply` files).

* **CloudCompare**  
  Advanced 3D point cloud visualization and comparison (e.g. before and after bundle adjustment).

## Notes
This repository is for learning purposes and documents the implementation and results of the course exercises.
